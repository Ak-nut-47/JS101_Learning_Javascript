// By declaring the variables and their values and then printing the product of the values

let one = 3;
let two = 5;
let three = 6;
let four = 9;
let five = 18;
console.log(one * two * three * four * five);


//alternate - By directly taking the values of the variables

console.log(3 * 5 * 6 * 9 * 18);

// considering the values are 3,5,6,8,9 for variables with names one,two,three,four,five respectively
